# OOP

The big movation of OOP: can put functions inside structs.

```c++
struct Student {
  int assms, mt, fn;
  float grade() {
    return assms + mt + fn;
  }
}

Student Billy = Student{60, 70, 80}
cout << Billy.grade() << endl;
```

In object oriented terminology, a class is essentially a struct type that can potentially contain functions. `Student` above is a class.

An object is an instance of a class

The functions inside a class are called member functions or methods.

But inside the function grade, what do the variables mean? Since these don't exist until a Student is instantiated? They refer to the fields of the object on which the method was invoked.

```c++
Student Billy{ ... };

Billy.grade(); // uses Billy's variables
```

Formally, methods take a hidden extra parameter with the name `this` which is a pointer to the object on which the method was invoked.

```c++
struct Student {
  int assms, mt, final;
  float grade() {
    return this->assms * 0.4 + this->mt * 0.2 + this->final * 0.4;
  }
}
```

## Separate compilation for classes

```c++
// Node.h
#ifndef __NODE_H__
#define __NODE_H__

struct Node {
  int data;
  Node *next;
  explicit Node(int, Node *next=nullptr);
  Node(const Node &o);
}

#endif
```

Don't create `struct Node` again in `Node.cc`

```c++
// Node.cc
#include "Node.h"

Node::Node(int data, Node *next) : data{data}, next{next} {}
Node::Node(const Node &o) : data{o.data} next{o.data ? new Node{o.next} : nullptr} {}
Node &Node::operator=( ... ) { ... }
```
